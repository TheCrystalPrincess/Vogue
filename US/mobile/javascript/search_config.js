I ask her about something she’d                 said a few times in 2021, that young                 women in pop music had an expi-                 ration date placed on them at age                 30. “I was under the impression,”                 she says, “that the younger you are,                 the more successful you’ll be in the                 music industry.” She’d always known                 that the paradigm was unfair; now                 she rejects, altogether, the idea that                 value is externally defined. “I think I                 believed in these false ideas for a little                 while,” she says. “The most painful                 moment of my life turned into my                 most successful.” For a minute she                 imagined that the more pain she was                 in, the more people would like her,                 the more money she would make.                 Now, she thinks you write good                 albums when you’re growing a lot,                 and that that’s a process that goes on                 all your life. Anyway, she doesn’t want                 to be a pop star forever, necessarily.                 What she cares about is that she can                 keep writing songs, whether for her-                 self or other people.                    One of the sticky points, for now, of                 Rodrigo writing autobiographically:                 The internet will instantly dissect the                 lyrics to find clues about her personal                 life. She’s careful, as we talk, not to go                 into specifics about the relationships                 chronicled in her new songs—about                 an older guy, for example, whom she                 calls a “bloodsucker, fame fucker,” in                 the lead single, “Vampire”: “I used to                 think you were smart, but you made                 me look so naive,” she sings, “the way                 you sold me for parts, you sunk your                 teeth into me.”                    I ask her if she’s single, and she                 makes a so-so gesture with her hand                 and says, cheerfully, “I don’t know!”                 Then she laughs, perhaps knowing                 this next part isn’t exactly true: “I don’t                 kiss and tell.                    “It’s an interesting thing to think                 about,” she says, diplomatically, about                 the public interest in her relationships,                 which she weathered in extremity                 while she was still in high school. “I                 understand it.

I had no idea                                                                                                         sional tour.

But                                                                                                         then, one day late last year, I found                                                                                                         myself setting up a couple of sessions                                                                                                         on the court.

I hit for 20, 30 minutes—I’m                                                                                                         ited me in Florida, I realized I needed                                                                                                           not sure how long, but at one point I                                                                                                         looked at him and said, “I feel like I’m                                                                                                         hitting it better than I ever have.

Do you want to go to college?”                                                                                                         And I looked him straight in the                                                                                                         eye and I said: “I want to be number","one in the world, and I want to win a                 Grand Slam.” The parents standing                 near me smiled the kind of smile that                 says, “Aww—look at this cute little                 kid and her crazy dreams.”                    Even then I had a burning ambi-                 tion to prove people wrong—to do                 things that people didn’t think I could                 do. Denmark is a small country, and                 nobody there had ever won a Grand                 Slam. So? I’d be the first—I’d show                 everybody that it’s possible, and then                 other kids could follow.                    Meanwhile, I was obsessed with                 Anna Kournikova’s tennis out-                 fits, which were so colorful and so                 stylish—I begged my parents to buy                 them for me, but my dad sat me down                 and told me: “All of this costs a lot of                 money. If it’s what you really want, I                 can get you the number of the CEO                 of Adidas Denmark—tell him who                 you are, what you do, and ask him.”                    Ten-year-old me was like, “Really?                 You’re going to ask me to call him?” A                 week went by, but then one day Dad                 told me that he’d found the phone                 number and that the CEO was                 expecting my call. I dialed the num-                 ber and heard this big, grown-up voice                 pick up the phone.                    “Hello. How can I help you?”                    I said, “Hi, my name is Caro-                 line Wozniacki. I play tennis. I’m                 really good. I won the national                 championships—six-love, six-love                 in all my matches. I’m going to be                 number one in the world, and I think                 you would like to get in on this early.”                 (Clearly, I did not suffer from a lack                 of confidence.)                    Soon after that, I would be sent                 the Adidas catalogs every season, and                 I could pick whatever I wanted. My                 favorites were these navy shorts with a                 belt and a navy sleeveless V-neck shirt,                 tucked in, that Kournikova wore. I                 started wearing that, along with this                 one-sleeve dress that I saw on Mar-                 tina Hingis, which I loved, and so                 much more. I was in heaven.                    I won the women’s national cham-                 pionship in Denmark, and then at                 15 I won the Wimbledon juniors,                 turned pro, and started living my                 dream. Five years later—on October                 10, 2010—I had done it: I was num-                 ber one in the world.                    It almost seemed too easy.

Look no further than these pointed-toe Prada slingbacks,                                   which positively come alive in a mellow yellow hue with tiny florets shaped from glossy                                       spazzolato leather. The result: a flat that possesses all the whimsy and vibrancy                                  of summer—along with the angles and architecture you’d expect from a fall shoe. And                                     while they’re perfect for city sidewalks, they’re somehow even more magical off-piste.
